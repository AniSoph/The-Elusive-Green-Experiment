# The-Elusive-Green-Experiment


In recent years the rise of social movements and political parties, concerned with climate protection, indicate a change in the  awareness of environmental issues. This greater awareness is reflected in an increase in environmentally friendly behaviour. People start caring more often about waste recycling or using environmentally friendly mobility.
However, not everyone is actually doing that. There is a notable gap between people saying that they want to act sustainable and how they actually behave as a consumer ((PROVE) consumer attitude-behaviour gap).
Customers may do small things to have a good feeling of being environmentally friendly and use this act as a justfication for subsequent non-environmentally friendly behaviour (QUOTE).
One example is the purchase of ecofriendly products like recycled clothes in an online store instead of buying it in a local store.
Especially in the context of online purchase, a non-environmental friendly behaviour of people who might be environmentally conscious becomes visible.

Thus, the current environmental trend does not only affect customers but also suppliers of services and goods.
The present online experiment should therefore uncover whether specific stimuli can convince a customer to use a more ecofriendly delivery choice.
In order to test whether social influences or informational influences are more effective in increasing environmental friendly behaviour, we conducted an experiment about online pruchase decisions. The experiment contains two treatment and one control groups.


Our research question: Is there a preference-action gap in green consumption and if so, can this gap be reduced by specific stimuli? 


    H1: External influences have an effect on the delivery decision. Without external influences participants are more likely to choose a 1-day delivery.

    H1a: The probability of choosing a 7-day delivery increases when individuals are facing social influences.   
        Underlying theory: herd behaviour (White et al. (2019); Chen (2008); Salazar et al. (2013); Tsarenko et al. (2013))
        Treatment: A chart indicating that most of their peers choose an eco-friendly delivery. 

    H1b: The probability of choosing a 7-day delivery increases when individuals are facing informational influences.  
        Underlying theory:   
        Treatment: A chart indicating of how much CO2 could be saved. 

    H2: Informational influences are reducing the preference-action gap to a greater extend than social influences.
        Underlying Theory: (Chen (2008))
