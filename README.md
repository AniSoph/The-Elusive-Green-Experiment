# The-Elusive-Green-Experiment


In recent years the rise of social movements and political parties, concerned with climate protection, indicate a change in the  awareness of environmental issues. This greater awareness is reflected in more. 


	Probably also a change in preferences towards environmental friendly behavior 
	However, there is a notable gap between people saying they want to act sustainable and how they actually behave as a consumer. (PROVE) consumer attitude-behaviour gap
Important because: Changes in the consumer behavior (market demand), have a big effect on the products or services companies offer.
	Is there a preference-action gap (higher preference than action) and if so can this gap be reduced by specific stimuli? 
(More about the effectiveness of specific treatments on decreasing the gap) 





Research question: Is there a preference-action gap in green consumption and if so, can this gap be reduced by specific stimuli? 


    H1: External influences have an effect on the delivery decision. Without external influences participants are more likely to choose a 1-day delivery.

    H1a: The probability of choosing a 7-day delivery increases when individuals are facing social influences.   
        Underlying theory: herd behaviour (White et al. (2019); Chen (2008); Salazar et al. (2013); Tsarenko et al. (2013))
        Treatment: A chart indicating that most of their peers choose an eco-friendly delivery. 

    H1b: The probability of choosing a 7-day delivery increases when individuals are facing informational influences.  
        Underlying theory:   
        Treatment: A chart indicating of how much CO2 could be saved. 

    H2: Informational influences are reducing the preference-action gap to a greater extend than social influences.
        Underlying Theory: (Chen (2008))
